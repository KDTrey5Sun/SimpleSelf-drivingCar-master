# Large files policy
# If you decide to use Git LFS (note: default GitHub LFS free quota is ~1GB storage + 1GB bandwidth/month),
# you can uncomment the lines below to track model artifacts. Given this repo's size, ignoring *.pt is safer.
#
# *.pt filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.pth filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.onnx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.ckpt filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
